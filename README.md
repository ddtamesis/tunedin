## What is TunedIn?

TunedIn provides a centralized application where users (specifically, college students in our first phase) automatically share the music that they are currently listening to on a given day, and are given the option to see other users that have similar music tastes to theirs as well as discover new music recommendations through peer users. \\
The issue that our project attempts to solve is the lack of a good social-media-type application solely for sharing music. We don’t count TikTok, since TikTok is primarily for sharing original video content. Although Spotify has a built-in social display feature, most people use Spotify just for their own music enjoyment and exploration instead of as a medium to connect with other people. We know that this is something people could use because our peers expressed enthusiasm about the project when we’ve asked them about it and we also have all had experiences where music has connected us. This article in particular highlights the importance of music in forming social bonds with others. \\
Because of the social-interaction focus of our project, our app may encourage people who do not typically listen to music to begin doing so in order to meet a greater community of people. Our project impacts people regardless of occupation, age, nationality, or racial group, but it definitely is biased towards people who can use the internet, as well as people who are not hearing impaired. In terms of accessibility, the app will likely be in English for the time being, but we may extend it to be more accessible to a wider range of languages in the future. Furthermore, at the beginning stages, this app will exclusively be accessible to college students at schools where we feel we can create enough buzz to start a user base.\\
How does our project add value? Our app will allow anybody to view the most recent TunedIn of other users. They could filter the display in terms of various parameters: genre, energy, song length, etc. Our app will group users with similar music preferences (based on those six metrics) together by calculating a general distance metric between any two users based on their present and historical music data. Finally, our app will provide a beautiful data visualization for our users, displaying each user as a bubble in a vast floating landscape of other users, allowing the user to sort the bubbles (visual clustering) by any category they wish, as well as click on individual bubbles to view the users themselves and their most recent activity. Our project will also form an overall sense of community amongst users via this musical exchange, and hopefully help people discover others who either share their tastes, or enjoy something completely different.\\



## Design Choices:

## Errors/Bugs:

At this time, there are no known bugs with our program.

## Tests:

## How-To:

### Running the backend server:

Run the server file. Then, use a web browser to navigate to `localhost:3232` which is where the server
is locally hosted. There are many different endpoints, some listed below:

```
Examples:

```

### Running tests:

For the backend, enter the backend folder and type `mvn test` in the terminal to run the tests. 
For the frontend, enter the frontend folder and type `npm test` in the terminal to run the tests.
